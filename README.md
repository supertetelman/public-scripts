# Summary
This is a collection of scripts that I have written for various clients, projects, and learning exercises.

Some of them are clean and polished, others less so. I believe they all have some value and I hope that you can find some use in them.

Most of these scripts will be in Python, several in Bash, and I expect there to be several other languages scattered in there.
