# Summary
This was a simple hello world script I wrote to help get my environment setup for developing and pushing applications to the Google Cloud.

This will download a sample Django git project, initialize the infrastructure on Google, and upload all the files.

Simple create a project in the Google Console, add your credentials to the config file, run the script, and follow the prompts.
