# Summary
This was a simple utility that I made up as a request for some clients.

The script is meant to be run in the background. Give it a directory, an interval, and either a screen or a box and it will take regular snapshots.

# Setup

It has a few python library dependcies that you will likely have to install, see the script for more details.
